    <p>This one really threw me even though the code was provided.<br>
      I delete the youtube link from the corner of the page but I could not get rid of the white square that was leftover<br>
      I did succeed in changing the background image though. I also slowed down the stick draw speed slightly because life is too short to play games on <i>hard</i> mode.</p>
